.SH NAME
rtplot \- RealTime Plotting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtplot -p ProjNum [-s NumSeconds]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rtplot 
performs realtime plotting of sample-rate ADS data.  It must be run from a
computer with an ADS or DSM attached, and WINDS must be running.
.B rtplot
will give you the option to display up to 5 variables at once from a list.
You only have the option of analog/digtial channels and variables from
block-probes (IRS, GPS, PMS1D, OphirIII), there are no derived variables
present.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 4
\f4\-p\f2 ProjNum\f1
Specify which project number is being run.  This is so rtplot can find the
header.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\f4\-s\f2 Seconds\f1
Specify how many seconds to display across the X axis.  This not changable
once the program is running.  The default is 10 seconds.
.SH RUNTIME OPTIONS
Through the
.B Edit Menu
there are several options:
.TP 4
\f4\Toggle Counts\f1
This toggles between
.B counts
and
.B engineering units.
The default at start up is
.B engineering units.
.TP 4
\f4\Toggle Snapshot Mode\f1
This toggles between updating once per second, the default, and once per
window size.  If you have set the number of seconds to 5 at startup, then
snapshot mode will show the previous 5 seconds worth of data for the next
5 seconds.
.TP 4
\f4\Toggle Grid\f1
Toggle a background grid on the data window.
.TP 4
\f4\Autscale Axies\f1
Autoscale axies.  This shouldn't be necessary, as autoscaling is performed
every screen update.
